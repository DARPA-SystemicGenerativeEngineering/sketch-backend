=== Readme first ===
    * See http://sketch.cs.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php/Development
        for more (updated) information about building from source.
    * Please read http://sketch.cs.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php/Download
        for instructions to install binary distributions.

=== Building ===

If you are using windows, start by running
    >>> bash convertScripts.sh

Then, configure and make SKETCH
    >>> ./autogen.sh
    >>> ./configure
    >>> make

Note: If you are using cygwin on Vista, perl 5.10 will crash. Use 5.8 instead.

=== Distributing ===

The frontend project, sketch-frontend, now handles building of all binary jar's (jar's which will extract the CEGIS backend automatically).
