Minor things:

- add required time support
- clean end-of-line markers (CR is more preferable than CR-LF)
- prevent node name clash between PO and internal names (i.e. [484])
- add the output of ABC version/platform in the output files  
- fix gcc compiler warnings                                   

Major things:

- substantially improving performance of FRAIGing 
(used in equivalence checking and lossless synthesis)

- developing a new (more efficient and faster) AIG rewriting package

- implementing additional rewriting options for delay optimization

- making technology mapping applicable to very large designs by adding 
on-demand cut computation currenlty available as a stand-alone command "cut"

- experimenting with yield-aware standard-cell mapping

- developing a mapper for arbitrary programmable macrocell 
architecture specified using a configuration file (this mapper should work 
for both cell-evalution and mainstream FPGA mapping)

- developing incremental retiming and incremental integrated sequential 
synthesis

- developing sequential verification combined with integrated sequential 
synthesis 


Other great projects:

- hierarchical BLIF input in ABC (output of black boxes)
- high-effort logic synthesis for hard miters (cofactoring, Boolean division)
- incremental retiming and sequential integration
- 5-6 input AIG rewriting using new ideas
- placement-aware mapping
- mapping into MV cells
- better ways of constructing BDDs
- SAT solver with linear constraints
- specialized synthesis for EXORs and large MUXes
- sequential AIG rewriting

Other:

- completely silent mode
